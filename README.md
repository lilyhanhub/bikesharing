# bikesharing
## Overview of the project
The purpose of the project is to analyze the NYC bikesharing data in August 2019 by creating analytic dashboards and a set of visual story for a business proposal. The analysis would help the investors with the decision-making process of a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa. The visual story will  
* Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
* Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
* Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
